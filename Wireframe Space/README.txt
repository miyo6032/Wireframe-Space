This is a work-in-progress game by Michael Yoshimura
It is an abstract space shooter, in which you can build and destroy ships piece by piece!

Controls:

'a' and 'd' to rotate your ship, and 'w' to move forward. 'space' to boost if you have a boost module.

Also scrolling while playing will either zoom in or out your field of view

Editor Controls:

Drag hexagons to the center board to start making your ship. 

A basic ship requires: A red 'cockpit' module, and a green 'movement' module (if you don't include the
movement module, you'll just be a turret.)

Middle click will duplicate modules, and right click with erase modules. 


If you are lost and have no idea how to play:

Click "Load a Different Ship" next to the space map in the bottom left corner

Click "Go To Ship Presets" in the upper right corner

Scroll around and choose an existing ship

The ship should now appear left of the space map

In the space map, there is a singular hexagon, which represents a sector in space.

Hover your mouse above it, and play the scene!
